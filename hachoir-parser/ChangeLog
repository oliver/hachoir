   maximum GIF picture width, etc.

Changes:
 * Lazy decompression for bzip2 and gzip parsers
 * ZIP: add more MIME types and file extensions
 * EXE: better PE detection

   netscape 2.0 extension
 * ID3v1: support ID3 version 1.1 and 1.1b (track number and genre)

 * Split run_testcase.py in three: download_testcase.py, run_testcase.py for
   hachoir-parser and run_testcase.py for hachoir-metadata
 * Update for hachoir-core 0.7:

   * Use NullBits/NullBytes for nul padding
   * Rename _createDescription() to createDescription()
   * Rename _createValue() to createValue()

 * Create function parseStream() to parse a stream
 * Palette is now PaletteRGB and is based on UserVector class

What's new in hachoir-parser 0.6?
=================================

News of version 0.6.2:

 * Fix Microsoft Office parser: misuse of new array() function
 * Fix SECT.display attribute (convert integer to string)

News of version 0.6.1:

 * Fix EXIF parser: SubFile import was missing

News of version 0.6:

 * hachoir-parser is now a separated component so it's easier to release
   new versions and write small bugfix
 * New parsers:
   * 3DO model (by Cyril Zorin)
   * Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   * MPEG video
   * Spider-Man video (by Mike Melanson)
   * Tcpdump: Ethernet, IPv4, ARP, ICMP, TCP, UDP
   * TIFF image
   * ZSNES save (by Jason Gorski)
 * Better parsers:
   * MPEG audio: support padding between frames, better file validation, and
   guess if bit rate is constant (CBR) or variable (VBR)
   * Python PYC: rewritten from scratch, now support python 1.5 to 2.5
   * ID3v2: support picture in v2.3.0, safer charset code
 * Many small bugfixes in ID3, MPEG audio and other parsers

Since hachoir core 0.6 is able to "autofix" more bugs, hachoir-parser 0.6 is
even stronger.
