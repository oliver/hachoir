hachoir-parser is a package of most common file format parsers written for
Hachoir framework. Not all parsers are complete, some are very good and other
are poor: only parser first level of the tree for example.

A perfect parser have no "raw" field: with a perfect parser you are able to
know *each* bit meaning. Some good (but not perfect ;-)) parsers:

 * Matroska video
 * Microsoft RIFF (AVI video, WAV audio, CDA file)
 * PNG picture
 * TAR and ZIP archive
