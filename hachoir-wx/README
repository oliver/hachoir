hachoir-wx is a wxWidgets-based program that's meant to provide a
(more) user-friendly interface to the facilities provided by the
hachoir binary parser core.

For latest updates, to ask for a feature (please do!), and
bleeding(-edge) source code see the website:

Everyone is very welcome to contribute code =)

hachoir-wx 0.1.1
================

Bugfixes:
 * Fix setup.py: install submodules!
 * setup.py uses distutils by default (and not setuptools)
 * Add some missing imports
 * Fix few typo errors

hachoir-wx 0.1 Initial Release (all platforms)
==============================================

Features:
 * Lazy-loaded hex view, meaning you can view a 20GB file and memory
   usage will remain constant, and the GUI will remain responsive.

 * Dynamic type conversion, meaning (for example) you can take a
   RawBytes field of size 4 and convert it to a UInt32 for a better
   look at your data.

 * Field splitting, meaning you can take a RawBytes range and split it
   into smaller ranges. This feature in conjunction with dynamic type
   conversion allows you to explore unknown binary formats more easily.

 * Field view that allows you to browse a binary file just like a
   directory.

 * Minor stuff like hex/dec view of addresses, absolute/relative field
   offsets, auto-resizing field view columns that stretch to the size of
   your data, etc.

 * Hex view automatically scrolls to and highlights the hex data of
   the currently selected field (called "marking".)

 * Field dumping, meaning you can select any field inside your binary
   file and save it on your hard disk for further
   examination/analysis/etc.

Bugs:
 * [All]: Field view "Merge Down" doesn't work.

 * [Windows only]: Hex view only shows a ~4x5 char display of the
   data. This is believed to be due to a wxWidgets bugs related to text
   wrapping.

 * [Windows only]: Right-click context menu doesn't work.

 * [Windows only]: Hex view data marking doesn't work.

 * [Gtk only]: Hex view will occasionally show two scrollbars for the
   hex view if you resize the very quickly. This is likely a bug in
   wxGtk that (for some reason) ignores the "no vertical scrollbar"
   directive for text controls.
